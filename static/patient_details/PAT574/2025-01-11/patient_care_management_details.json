The patient is advised to take Paracetamol 500 mg after breakfast to address inflammation and discomfort in the joints, Glucosamine 1000 mg after lunch to support cartilage repair, 5 mg of Melatonin 30 minutes before bedtime to regulate sleep, 10 mg Cetirizine at night to alleviate underlying inflammation or allergy, and Vitamin D3 1000 IU in the morning to boost the immune system and enhance energy levels. Additionally, the patient is prescribed Losartan 50 mg before breakfast to manage blood pressure and improve cardiovascular health. To alleviate knee pain and stiffness, the patient is advised to apply a cold compress to the area in the evening and perform regular stretching exercises. A B12 injection once a month is also recommended to improve energy levels. The patient's diet should consist of a nutritious breakfast with oatmeal, fruits, and almonds, a lean protein lunch with quinoa and leafy greens, and a grilled salmon dinner with roasted sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli. The patient should avoid consuming heavy carbs late at night, drink at least 2 to 3 liters of water per day, and engage in low-impact activities like swimming or walking for at least 30 minutes every day. A consistent routine of 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night in a cool, dark room is essential. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up in 6 weeks to assess progress."
