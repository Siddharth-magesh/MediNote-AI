The patient is advised to take Paracetamol 500 mg after breakfast to address joint inflammation and discomfort, Glucosamine 1000 mg after lunch to support cartilage repair, and Melatonin 5 mg 30 minutes before bedtime to regulate sleep. Additionally, the patient should take Cetirizine 10 mg at night, Vitamin D3 1000 IU in the morning, and Losartan 50 mg before breakfast to manage blood pressure and overall cardiovascular health. To alleviate knee pain and stiffness, the patient can apply a cold compress in the evening and incorporate regular stretching exercises into their routine. The doctor also suggests a B12 injection once a month to improve energy levels. In terms of diet, the patient is recommended to start the day with oatmeal, fruits, and nuts, have lean protein and leafy greens for lunch, and grilled salmon with sweet potatoes and broccoli for dinner. The patient should avoid consuming heavy carbs at night, drink at least 2 to 3 liters of water per day, and engage in low-impact exercises like swimming or walking for 30 minutes daily. A consistent sleep routine of 7 to 8 hours per night in a cool, dark room is also essential. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up in 6 weeks to assess progress."
